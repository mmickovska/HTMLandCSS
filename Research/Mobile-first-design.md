### Mobile first design is a design strategy that says when you create a website or app, you should start sketching and prototyping the smallest screen first and work your way up to larger screens. Essentially, it’s about delivering the right user experience to the right device.

The reason that this makes sense is because with such limited real estate on small screens, UX designers must prioritize the most important aspects of their website and apps, namely content.

For many years, mobile websites were an afterthought to the design process. An addition not a necessity. The slow decline of desktop coupled with the rise of mobile phones over the last 5 years has shown that mobile first design has to take priority.

Benefits of mobile first design
Mobile conversions rates are up 64% when compared with the average desktop conversion rates. So designing mobile first can lead to more profit for your business. And since Google ranks for mobile-friendliness, it makes sense to bear this in mind when starting a new project.

This way of designing is also beneficial when it comes to download times and users accessing your content as quickly as possible. With fewer elements, the page will load faster. When you consider a 1 second delay causing a 7% loss in conversions – it pays to design mobile first.

When you design from the smallest screen to the largest screen, this is known as progressive enhancement. It’s about designing with a strong foundation and adding enhancements as you go.

With mobile first, you create your strong foundation. This foundation will help strengthen other designs for tablet and desktop. The foundation should always be content and mobile first design emphasizes content over navigation – users get the information they need quicker.

This will also make your life easier since mobile first design starts off with the tackling the hardest screen size to design for. The rest inevitably falls into place.

Mobile first design forces you to really focus and maintain clarity by removing any unnecessary user interface decoration. By removing any distractions, you’ll invariably improve the user experience and that makes good business sense.
